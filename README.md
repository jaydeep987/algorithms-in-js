# Data structure and various algorithms in JavaScript

Trying to make good resource for people who want to understand data structures and algorithms, and those who want to know how it can be implemented in Javascript!

Mainly this project will be written in `typescript` and future plan is to make public website with tutorials in it by using this repo.

__Currently it's at very basic phase. As per time availability, I will be making it better.__
